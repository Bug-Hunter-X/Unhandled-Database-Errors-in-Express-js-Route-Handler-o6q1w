# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that lacks proper error handling, potentially causing crashes or unexpected responses. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database.  However, it doesn't handle potential errors during the database operation effectively.  If the database query fails, the application might crash or return an unhelpful error message to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the route handler. It includes comprehensive error handling, ensuring that database errors are gracefully managed and appropriate responses are sent to the client.  This approach maintains application stability and provides informative error messages for debugging purposes.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Run `bug.js` 
2. Simulate a database error (e.g., by intentionally causing a connection failure or querying a non-existent user)
3. Observe the application's behavior and error messages.
